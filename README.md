# Architectural-Heritage-Elements-image-[Dataset](https://old.datahub.io/dataset/architectural-heritage-elements-image-dataset)

Tried to classify images using ANN but couldn't do it even on the Colab as the memory ran out.

Built a CNN model to classify images.

**Learned practically why CNN should be used for image classification/detection**
